\details{

  Experiments were conducted at three locations in Southern Alberta at
  Lethbridge, Vauxhall, and Cranford in 1956. Plot layout was 32 rows,
  each 179 feet long, allowing 18 ten-foot plots per row. Rows were 3
  feet apart, thinned to one foot between plants.  A double guard row
  surrounded the entire plot.  The same two persons were assigned to
  harvest the corn from all locations.  All 576 plots were harvested in
  one day. Optimal plot sizes were found to be 10ft x 6ft or 20ft by
  3ft. The R data uses row/column for plot/row.
  
  Field width: 18 plots * 10 ft = 180 feet

  Field length: 32 rows * 3 ft = 96 feet
