\details{
  An experiment grown in 1949 at the Worthy Park Estate in Jamaica.
  
  There were 5 treatment factors:

  3 Nitrogen levels: 0, 3, 6 hundred-weight per acre.

  3 Phosphorous levels: 0, 4, 8 hundred-weight per acre.
  
  3 Potassium (muriate of potash) levels: 0, 1, 2 hundred-weight
  per acre.
  
  3 Bagasse (applied pre-plant) levels: 0, 20, 40 tons per acre.

  3 Filter press mud (applied pre-plant) levels: 0, 10, 20 tons per acre.

  
  Each plot was 18 yards long by 6 yards (3 rows) wide. Plots were
  arranged in nine columns of nine, a 2-yard space separating plots
  along the rows and two guard rows separating plots across the rows.
  
  Field width: 6 yards * 9 plots + 4 yards * 8 gaps = 86 yards

  Field length: 18 yards * 9 plots + 2 yards * 8 gaps = 178 yards
