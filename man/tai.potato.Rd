\usage{data("tai.potato")}
\format{
  A data frame with 48 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, kg/plot}
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype code}
    \item{\code{variety}}{variety name}
    \item{\code{env}}{environment code}
    \item{\code{loc}}{location}
    \item{\code{year}}{year}
  }
}
\details{
  Mean tuber yield of 8 genotypes in 3 locations over two years.
  Katahdin and Sebago are check varieties.  Each location was planted as
  a 4-rep RCB design.

  In Tai's plot of the stability parameters, F5751 and Sebago were in
  the average stability area.  The highest yielding genotype F6032 had
  an unstable performance.
