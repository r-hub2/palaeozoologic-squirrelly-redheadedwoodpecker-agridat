  Weight gain in pigs for different treatments

\description{
  Weight gain in pigs for different treatments, with initial weight and
  feed eaten as covariates.

\usage{data("woodman.pig")}
\format{
  A data frame with 30 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pen}}{pen}
    \item{\code{treatment}}{diet}
    \item{\code{pig}}{pig number}
    \item{\code{sex}}{sex}
    \item{\code{weight1}}{initial weight in pounds, week 0}
    \item{\code{weight2}}{final weight in pounds, week 16}
    \item{\code{feed}}{feed eaten in pounds}
    \item{\code{w0}}{initial weight}
    \item{\code{g}}{average weekly gain}
    \item{\code{h}}{half rate of change in growth}
  }

\details{
  
  Six pigs in each of 5 pens were fed individually. From each litter
  there were 3 males and 3 females chosen for a pen. Three different
  diet treatments were used.

  Note: Woodman gives the initial weights to the nearest 0.5
  pounds.

  The w0, g, h columns are from Wishart 1938. Wishart used the weekly
  weight measurements (not available) to fit quadratic growth curves for
  each pig and then reported the constants. These are the data that are
  widely used by many authors.
