\description{
  Potato scab infection with sulfur treatments
}

\format{
  A data frame with 32 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{inf}}{infection percent}
    \item{\code{trt}}{treatment factor}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
  }
}
\details{
  The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of sulfur on
  controlling scab disease in potatoes. There were seven treatments.
  Control, plus spring and fall application of 300, 600, 1200 pounds/acre of
  sulfur.  The response variable was infection as a percent of the surface
  area covered with scab.  A completely randomized design was used with 8
  replications of the control and 4 replications of the other treatments.
  
  Although the original analysis did not show significant differences in
  the sulfur treatments, including a polynomial trend in the model
  uncovered significant differences (Tamura, 1988).
