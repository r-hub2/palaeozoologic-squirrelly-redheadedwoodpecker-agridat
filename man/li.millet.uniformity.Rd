  Uniformity trial of millet

\description{
  Uniformity trial of millet at China in 1934.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 600 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield (grams)}
  }
}
\details{

  Crop date estimated to be 1934.
  
  Field was 100 ft x 100 ft.  Plots were 15 feet long by 1 foot wide.

  Field width: 100 plots * 1 foot = 100 feet

  Field length: 6 plots * 15 feet = 100 feet

  Li found the most efficient use of land was obtained with plats 15
  feet long and two rowss wide.  Also satisfactory would be one row 30
  feet long.
