\usage{data("christidis.cotton.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 1024 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, kg/unit}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor}
  }
}
\details{
  The experiment was conducted in 1938 at Sindos by the Greek Cotton Research Institute.

  Each block consisted of 20 rows, 1 meter apart and 66 meters long. Two
  rows on each side and 1 meter on each end were removed for
  borders. Each row was divided into 4 meter-lengths and harvested
  separately.  There were 4 blocks, oriented at 0, 30, 60, 90 degrees.

  Each block contained 16 rows, each 64 meters long.

  Field width: 16 units * 4 m = 64 m

  Field depth: 16 rows * 1 m = 16 m
