\description{
  Average daily gain of 65 steers for 3 lines, 9 sires.
}
\usage{data("harvey.lsmeans")}
\format{
  A data frame with 65 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{line}}{line of the dam}
    \item{\code{sire}}{sire}
    \item{\code{damage}}{age class of the dam}
    \item{\code{calf}}{calf number}
    \item{\code{weanage}}{calf age at weaning}
    \item{\code{weight}}{calf weight at start of feeding}
    \item{\code{adg}}{average daily gain}
  }
}
\details{
  The average daily gain 'adg' for each of 65 Hereford steers.

  The calf age at weaning and initial weight at the beginning of the
  test feeding is also given.

  The steers were fed for the same length of time in the feed lot.

  It is assumed that each calf has a unique dam and there are no twins
  or repeat matings.

  Harvey (1960) is one of the earliest papers presenting least squares
  means (lsmeans).
