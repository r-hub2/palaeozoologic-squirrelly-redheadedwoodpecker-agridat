\usage{data("jayaraman.bamboo")}
\format{
  A data frame with 216 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{loc}}{location factor}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor}
    \item{\code{tree}}{tree factor}
    \item{\code{family}}{family factor}
    \item{\code{height}}{height, cm}
  }
}
\details{
  Data from a replicated trial of bamboo at two locations in Kerala,
  India.  Each location had 3 blocks.  In each block were 6 families,
  with 6 trees in each family.
