\details{

  Nine genotypes/varieties of cotton were used in a variety test.
  The plots were 100 meters long and 2.40 meters wide, each plot having
  3 rows 0.80 meters apart.  

  The layout was an RCB of 5 blocks, each block having 2 replicates of
  every variety (with the original intention of trying 2 seed
  treatments). Each row was harvested/weighed separately.
  After the leaves of the plants had dried up and fallen, the mean
  height of each row was measured.

  Christidis found significant competition between varieties, but not
  due to height differences. Crude analysis.

  TODO: Find a better analysis of this data which incorporates field
  trends AND competition effects, maybe including a random effect for
  border rows of all genotype pairs (as neighbors)?
