\details{
  On the University of Nottingham farm, 13 different strains and species
  of herbage plants were sown on about 4 acres in an RCB design.  Each
  grass species was sown together with white clover seed.

  During establishment of the herbage plants, it became apparent that
  \emph{Urtica dioica} (nettle) became established according to the
  particular herbage plant in each plot.  In particular, nettle became
  established in plots sown with leguminous species and the two grass
  species.  The graminaceous plots had less nettles.

  The data here are the percentage ground cover of nettle and herbage
  plants in September 1951.

  Note, some of the percent ground cover amounts were originally
  reported as 'trace'. These have been arbitrarily set to 0.1 in this
  data.
