\usage{data("jansen.strawberry")}
\format{
  A data frame with 144 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{male}}{male parent}
    \item{\code{female}}{female parent}
    \item{\code{block}}{block}
    \item{\code{category}}{disease damage, \code{C1} < \code{C2} < \code{C3}}
    \item{\code{count}}{number of plants in each category}
  }
}
\details{

  In strawberries, red core disease is caused by a fungus,
  \emph{Phytophtora fragariae}.  This experiment evaluated different
  populations for damage caused by red core disease.

  There were 3 male strawberry plants and 4 DIFFERENT female strawberry
  plants that were crossed to create 12 populations.
  Note: Jansen labeled the male parents 1,2,3 and the female parents
  1,2,3,4.  To reduce confusion, this data labels the female parents 5,6,7,8.

  The experiment had four blocks with 12 plots each (one for each
  population).  Plots usually had 10 plants, but some plots only had 9
  plants.  Each plant was assessed for damage from fungus and rated as
  belonging to category C1, C2, or C3 (increasing damage).
