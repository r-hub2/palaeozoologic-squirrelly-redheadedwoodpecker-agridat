  Uniformity trial of corn at 3 locations in Iowa.

\usage{data("bryan.corn.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 1728 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{expt}}{experiment (variety/orientation)}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, pounds per plot}
  }
}
\details{
  Three varieties of corn were planted.
  Each experiment was 48 rows, each row 48 hills long, .65 acres.
  A "hill" is a single hole with possibly multiple seeds.
  Spacing between the hills would be sqrt(43560 sq ft * .64) / 48 = 3.5 feet.

  In the experiment code, K=Krug, I=Iodent, M=McCulloch (varieties of
  corn), 23=1923, 25=1925, E=East/West, N=North/South.
  
  Each experiment was aggregated into experimental units by combining 8
  hills, both in East/West direction and also in North/South direction.
  Thus, each field is represented twice in the data, once with "E" in
  the field name and once with "N".
