\format{
  A data frame with 760 observations on the following 3 variables.

\details{
  Conducted at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute in 1928. A
  rectangle 250 x 200 links was selected, divided into 1000 plots
  measuring 10 x 5 links, that is 1/2000th acre. 
  Plots were hand harvested for herbage and air-dried. Cutting began
  Tue, 25 Sep and ended Sat, 29 Sep, by which time 760 plots had been
  harvested. Rain fell, harvesting ceased. 
  
  The minimum recommended plot size is 150 square links. The optimum
  recommended plot size is 450 square links, 5 x 90 links in size. 
  
  Note, there were 4 digits that were hard to read in the original
  document. Best estimates of these digits were used for the yields of
  the affects plots.  The yields were digitally watermarked with an
  extra .01 added to the yield value.

  The botanical composition of species clearly influenced the total herbage.

  Field length: 40 plots * 5 links = 200 links

  Field width: 19 plots * 10 links = 190 links
