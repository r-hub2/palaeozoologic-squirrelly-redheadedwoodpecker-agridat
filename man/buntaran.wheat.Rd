\usage{data("buntaran.wheat")}
\format{
  A data frame with 1069 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{zone}}{Geographic zone: south, middle, north}
    \item{\code{loc}}{Location}
    \item{\code{rep}}{Block replicate (up to 4)}
    \item{\code{alpha}}{Incomplete-block in the alpha design}
    \item{\code{gen}}{Genotype (cultivar)}
    \item{\code{yield}}{Dry matter yield, kg/ha}
  }
}
\details{
  Dry matter yield from wheat trials in Sweden in 2016. The experiments
  in each location were multi-rep with incomplete blocks in an alpha
  design.
  
  Electronic data are from the online supplement of Buntaran (2020) and also from the "init" package at https://github.com/Flavjack/inti.
