    \item{\code{trt}}{Treatment factor, 1-6}
    \item{\code{vine}}{Vine factor, 1-3}

\details{
  
  These data come from a study of downy mildew on grapes.  The
  experiment was conducted at Wooster, Ohio, on the experimental farm of
  the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Ohio State
  University.

  There were 3 blocks with 6 treatments.  Treatment 1 is
  the unsprayed control.  On 30 Sep 1990, disease incidence was
  measured.  For each plot, 5 randomly chosen shoots on each of the 3
  vines were observed.  The canopy was closed and shoots could be
  intertwined.  On each shoot, the total number of leaves and the number
  of infected leaves were recorded.
