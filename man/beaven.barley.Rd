\usage{data("beaven.barley")}
\format{
  A data frame with 160 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield (grams)}
  }

\details{

  Eight races of barley were grown on a regular pattern of plots.

  These data were prepared from Richey (1926) because the text was
  cleaner.

  Each plot was planted 40 inches on a side, but only the middle square
  36 inches on a side was harvested.

  Field width: 32 plots * 3 feet = 96 feet

  Field length: 5 plots * 3 feet = 15 feet
