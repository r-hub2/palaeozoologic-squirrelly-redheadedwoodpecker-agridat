\details{
  Two crops of peanuts were grown in North Carolina in 1939 and 1940.
  A different field was used each year.
  
  A block of 36 rows 3 feet wide and 200 feet long were harvested in 12.5 foot lengths.

  Field length: 36 plots * 12.5 feet = 200 feet
  
  Field width: 16 plots * 3 feet = 48 feet
  
  Widening the plot was not as effective as increasing the plot length
  in order to reduce error. This agrees with the results of other
  uniformity studies.
  
  Assuming 30 percent of the total cost of an experiment is proportional
  to the size of the plots used, the optimum plot size is approximately
  3.2 units.
