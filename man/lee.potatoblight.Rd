\details{

These data werre collected from biennial screening trials conducted by
the New Zealand Institute of Crop and Food Research at the Pukekohe
Field Station.  The trials evaluate the resistance of potato cultivars
to late blight caused by the fungus \emph{Phytophthora infestans}. In
each trial, the damage to necrotic tissue was rated on a 1-9 scale at
multiple time points during the growing season.

Lee (2009) used a Bayesian model that extends the ordinal regression of
McCullagh to include spatial variation and sigmoid logistic curves to model
the time dependence of repeated measurements on the same plot.

Data from 1989 were not included due to a different trial setup being
used.  All the trials here  were laid out as latinized row-column
designs with 4 or 5 reps.  Each plot consisted of four seed tubers
planted with two Ilam Hardy spread plants in a single row 2 meters long
with 76 centimeter spacing between rows.

In 1997, 18 plots were lost due to flooding. In 2001, by the end of the
season most plants were nearly dead.

Note, in plant-breeding, it is common to use a "breeder code" for each genotype,
which after several years of testing is changed to a registered
commercial variety name.
For this R package, the Potato Pedigree Database,
https://www.plantbreeding.wur.nl/potatopedigree/reverselookup.php,
was used to change breeder codes (in early testing) to the variety names
used in later testing.  For example, among the changes made were the
following:
  \tabular{ll}{
    Driver \tab 287.12 \cr
    Kiwitea \tab 064/56 \cr
    Gladiator \tab 1308.66 \cr
    Karaka \tab 221.17 \cr
    Kiwitea \tab 064.56 maybe 064.54 \cr
