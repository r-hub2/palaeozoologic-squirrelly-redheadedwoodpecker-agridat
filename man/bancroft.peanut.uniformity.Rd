\description{
  Uniformity trial of peanuts in Alabama, 1946.

\usage{data("bancroft.peanut.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 216 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, pounds per plot}
    \item{\code{block}}{block}
  }
}
\details{
  The data are obtained from two parts of the same field, located at
  Wiregrass Substation, Headland, Alabama, USA.  Each part had 18 rows,
  3 feet wide, 100 feet long. Plots were harvested in 1946. Green
  weights in pounds were recorded.

  Each plot was 16.66 linear feet of row and 3 feet in width, 50 sq feet.

  Field width: 6 plots * 16.66 feet = 100 feet

  Field length: 18 plots * 3 feet = 54 feet

  Conclusions:
  Based on the relative efficiencies, increasing the size of the plot
  along the row is better than across the row.  Narrow, rectangular
  plots are more efficient.
