\usage{data("lord.rice.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 560 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{field}}{field}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{grain}}{grain weight, pounds per plot}
    \item{\code{straw}}{straw weight, pounds per plot}
  }
}
\details{
  In 1929, eight fields 1/5 acre in size were broadcast seeded with rice
  at the Anuradhapura Experiment Station in the northern dry zone of
  Ceylon. After broadcast, the fields were marked into 10 ft by 10 ft
  squares. At harvest, weights of grain and straw were recorded.

  Fields 10-14 were on one side of a drain, and fields 26-28 on the
  other side.

  Each field was surrounded by a bund. Plots next to the bunds had higher
  yields.
  
  Field width: 5 plots * 10 feet = 50 feet

  Field length: 14 plots * 10 feet = 140 feet

  Conclusions: "It would appear that plots of about 1/87 acre are the most effective."
