  Average monthly soil temperature near Zurich
}
\description{
  Average monthly soil temperature near Zurich, at seven depths,
  averaged over four years.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 84 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{month}}{month}
    \item{\code{depth}}{depth in soil (feet)}
    \item{\code{temp}}{temperature (the units are "du Crest")}
  }
}
\details{
  This is one of the earliest time series in scientific literature.

  These data show the monthly soil temperature near Zurich, averaged
  over four years (beginning in 1762), at 7 different depths.

  The temperature measurements are related to the 'du Crest' scale.
  (The measurements do not seem to be exactly according to the du Crest
  scale.  If you can read German, use the Google books link to see if
  you can figure out why.)  Even the scale on Lambert's own graph
  doesn't match the data.

  Greater depths show less variation and a greater lag in temperature
  responsiveness to the air temperature.

  This data also appears in Pedometrics, issue 23, December 2007.  But,
  the formula for converting the temperature does not make sense and the
  data in Table 1 do not directly match the corresponding figure.
