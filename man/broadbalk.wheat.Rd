  Note: This data is only 1852-1925.  You can find recent data for these
  experiments at the Electronic Rothamsted Archive:

  Rothamsted Experiment station conducted wheat experiments on the
  Broadbalk Fields beginning in 1844 with data for yields of grain and
  straw collected from 1852 to 1925.
  Ronald Fisher was hired to analyze data from the agricultural trials.
  Organic manures and inorganic fertilizer treatments were applied in
  various combinations to the plots.

  N1 is 48kg, N1.5 is 72kg, N2 is 96kg, N4 is 192kg nitrogen.
