\usage{data("ducker.groundnut.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 215 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row ordinate}
    \item{\code{col}}{column ordinate}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, pounds per plot}
  }

\details{
  The experiment was grown in Nyasaland, Cotton Experiment Station,
  Domira Bay, 1942-43. There were 44x5 identical plots, each 1/220 acre
  in area. Single ridge plots each one chain in length, and one yard
  apart. Two rows of groundnuts are planted per ridge, staggered at 1
  foot between holes. Holes are spaced 18 inches x 12 inches. Two seeds
  are planted per hole.
  
  The yield values are pounds of nuts in shell.
  
  Field length: 5 plots, 22 yards each = 110 yards.
  
  Field width: 44 plots, 1 yard each = 44 yards.

  This data was made available with special help from the staff at
  Rothamsted Research Library.

  Data typed by K.Wright and checked by hand.
