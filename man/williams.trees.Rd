  Multi-environment trial of trees, height / survival of 37 species at 6 sites in Thailand
}

\format{
  A data frame with 222 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{env}}{Environment factor, 6 levels}
    \item{\code{gen}}{Genetic factor, 37 levels}
    \item{\code{height}}{Height (cm)}
    \item{\code{survival}}{Survival percentage}
  }
}
\details{
  Planted in 1985 at six sites in Thailand.  RCB with 3 reps.  The data
  here is the mean of the three reps.  Plots were 5 meters square with
  spacing 2m x 2m.  Measurements collected at 24 months.  The \code{gen}
  column in the data is actually \emph{seedlot}, as some tree species
  have multiple seed lots.  The trees are mostly acacia and eucalyptus.
