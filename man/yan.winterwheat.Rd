  Multi-environment trial of winter wheat in Ontario
}
\description{
  Yield of 18 varieties of winter wheat grown at 9 environments in
  Ontario in 1993.
}
\details{
  The yield is the mean of several reps, measured in metric tons per hectare.

  This data has often been used to illustrate GGE biplots.
}


\format{
  A data frame with 162 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype}
    \item{\code{env}}{environment}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield in metric tons per hectare}
