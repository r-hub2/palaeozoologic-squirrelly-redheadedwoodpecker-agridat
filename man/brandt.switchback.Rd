\details{
  
  In this experiment, 10 cows were selected from the Iowa State College
  Holstein-Friesian herd and divided into two equal groups. Care was
  taken to have the groups as nearly equal as possible with regard to
  milk production, stage of gestation, body weight, condition and
  age. These cows were each given 10 pounds of timothy hay and 30 pounds
  of corn silage daily but were fed different grain mixtures. Treatment
  T1, then, consisted of feeding a grain mixture of 1 part of corn and
  cob meal to 1 part of ground oats, while treatment T2 consisted of
  feeding a grain mixture of 4 parts corn and cob meal, 4 parts of
  ground oats and 3 parts of gluten feed. The three treatment periods
  covered 105 days -- three periods of 35 days each. The yields for the
  first 7 days of each period were not considered because of the
  possible effect of the transition from one treatment to the other. The
  data, together with sums and differences which aid in the calculations
  incidental to testing, are given in table 2.

  It seems safe to conclude that the inclusion of gluten feed in the
  grain mixture fed in a timothy hay ration to Holstein-Friesian cows
  increased the production of milk. The average increase was 21.7 pounds
  per cow for a 28-day period.
