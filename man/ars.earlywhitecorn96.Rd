    Multi-environment trial of early white food corn
}
\description{
  Multi-environment trial of early white food corn for 60 white hybrids.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 540 observations on the following 9 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{loc}}{location, 9 levels}
    \item{\code{gen}}{gen, 60 levels}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, bu/ac}
    \item{\code{stand}}{stand, percent}
    \item{\code{rootlodge}}{root lodging, percent}
    \item{\code{stalklodge}}{stalk lodging, percent}
    \item{\code{earht}}{ear height, inches}
    \item{\code{flower}}{days to flower}
    \item{\code{moisture}}{moisture, percent}
  }
}
\details{
  Data are the average of 3 replications.

  Yields were measured for each plot and converted to bushels / acre and
  adjusted to 15.5 percent moisture.

  Stand is expressed as a percentage of the optimum plant stand.

  Lodging is expressed as a percentage of the total plants for each hybrid.

  Ear height was measured from soil level to the top ear leaf collar.
  Heights are expressed in inches.

  Days to flowering is the number of days from planting to mid-tassel or mid-silk.

  Moisture of the grain was measured at harvest.
