  Multi-environment trial of wheat, conventional and semi-dwarf varieties
}
\description{
  Multi-environment trial of wheat, conventional and semi-dwarf
  varieties, 7 locs with low/high fertilizer levels.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 168 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype}
    \item{\code{loc}}{location}
    \item{\code{nitro}}{nitrogen fertilizer, low/high}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield (g/m^2)}
    \item{\code{type}}{type factor, conventional/semi-dwarf}
  }
}
\details{
  Conducted in U.K. in 1975.  Each loc had three reps, two nitrogen
  treatments.

  Locations were Begbroke, Boxworth, Crafts Hill, Earith, Edinburgh,
  Fowlmere, Trumpington.

  At the two highest-yielding locations, Earith and Edinburgh, yield was
  _lower_ for the high-nitrogen treatment.  Blackman et al. say "it
  seems probable that effects on development and structure of the crop
  were responsible for the reductions in yield at high nitrogen".
