  Sample of egg weights on 24 consecutive days
}
\usage{data("goulden.eggs")}
\format{
  A data frame with 240 observations on the following 2 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{day}}{day}
    \item{\code{weight}}{weight}
  }
}
\details{

  Data are the weights of 10 eggs taken at random on each day for 24
  days.  Day 1 was Dec 10, and Day 24 was Jan 2.

  The control chart for standard deviations shows 4 values beyond the
  upper limits. The data reveals a single, unusually large egg on each
  of these days.  These are almost surely double-yolk eggs.
