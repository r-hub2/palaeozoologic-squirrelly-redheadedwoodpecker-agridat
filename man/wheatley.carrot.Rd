  Insecticide treatments for carrot fly larvae
}
\description{
  Insecticide treatments for carrot fly larvae.
  Two insecticides with five depths.
}
\usage{data("wheatley.carrot")}
\format{
  A data frame with 36 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{treatment}}{treatment factor, 11 levels}
    \item{\code{insecticide}}{insecticide factor}
    \item{\code{depth}}{depth}
    \item{\code{rep}}{block}
    \item{\code{damaged}}{number of damaged plants}
    \item{\code{total}}{total number of plants}
  }
}
\details{
  
  In 1964 an experiment was conducted with microplots to evaluate the
  effectiveness of treatments against carrot fly larvae.
  The treatment factor is a combination of insecticide and depth.
  
  Hardin & Hilbe used this data to fit a generalized binomial model.

  Famoye (1995) used the same data to fit a generalized binomial regression model.
  Results for Famoye are not shown.
