\title{
  Sugar beet trial with competition effects
}
\description{
  Yield of sugar beets for 36 varieties in a 3-rep RCB experiment.
  Competition effects are present.
}

\format{
  A data frame with 108 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype, 36 levels}
    \item{\code{rep}}{rep, 3 levels}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield, kg/plot}
  }
}
\details{
  Entries are grown in 12m rows, 0.5m apart.  Guard rows were grown
  alongside replicate boundaries, but yields of these plots are not
  included.
