\format{
  A data frame with 405 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{block}}{block/field}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield}
    \item{\code{date}}{planting date, 5 levels}
    \item{\code{gen}}{genotype/variety, 3 levels}
    \item{\code{treat}}{treatment combination, 135 levels}
    \item{\code{seeds}}{number of seeds per hole, 3 levels}

\details{
  There were 4 treatment factors:
                       
  3 Genotypes (varieties): Nehara, Bhasamanik, Bhasakalma
  
  5 Planting dates: Jul 16, Aug 1, Aug 16, Sep 1, Sep 16

  3 Spacings: 6 in, 9 in, 12 inches

  3 Seedlings per hole: 1, 2, local method

  
  There were 3x5x3x3=135 treatment combinations. 
  The experiment was divided in 3 blocks (fields).
  Total 405 plots. 

  "The plots of the same sowing date within each block were grouped
  together, and the position occupied by the sowing date groups within
  Within the blocks were determined at random. This grouping together of
  plots of the same sewing date was adopted to facilitate cultural
  operations. For the same reason, the three varieties were also laid
  out in compact rows. The nine combinations of spacings and seedling
  numbers were then thrown at random within each combination of date of
  planting and variety as shown in the diagram."

  Note: The diagram appears to show the treatment combinations, NOT the
  physical layout.

  Basically, date is a whole-plot effect, genotype is a sub-plot effect,
  and the 9 treatments (spacings * seedlings) are completely randomized
  withing the sub-plot effect.
