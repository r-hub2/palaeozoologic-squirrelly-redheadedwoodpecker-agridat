\description{
  Uniformity trial of canning peas in southern Alberta, 1957.

\usage{data("nonnecke.peas.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 540 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor}
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{vines}}{vines weight, pounds}
    \item{\code{peas}}{shelled peas weight, pounds}
  }

\details{
  
  Width of basic plot was 10 feet, length was 5 feet, as limited by the
  viner. At each of two blocks/locations, planting consisted of 18 rows
  (only 15 rows were harvested) that were 10 feet wide and 90 feet
  long. Rows were separated by 7 foot bare ground to facilitate
  harvesting. Nonnecke 1960 shows a map of one block.

  Plots were harvested with a five foot mower. Vines from
  each plot were weighed, then shelled.  The two blocks/locations were
  side by side and combined by Nonnecke. The optimum plot size was found
  to be 5 feet long and 10 feet wide.

  Field width: 15 rows * 10 ft/row + 14 gaps * 7 ft/gap = 248 feet

  Field length: 18 plots * 5 ft/plot = 90 feet
